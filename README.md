This is Unity Game Assignment for Animoca Brands

Hey,
Please find the entire requirement done.
As for the nice to have section, Please find below what things are done:

Using latest Android sdk, added icon and splash screen
● Make use of the Android back button.
● Make the game work for different aspect ratios, mobile and tablet.
● Make the power bar move a different speed if it is closer to the end of the bar.
● Be able to have some kind of game configuration where you can modify certain
values for the game for the developer. These values could be:
○ Amount of points given for each hole. (you can change hole value at BallHole GameObject) 
○ The duration of the timer of each game. (you can change timer value at GameHelper GameObject)
○ Speed (or time to complete) of the Power bar. (you can change power bar speed value at GameHelper GameObject)
